# PyCity Schools Analysis


 City's school district Chief Data Scientist will be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.




## Project Overview



 
•	Create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a Dataframe(District Summary). 

•	Create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school(School Summary).

•	Find the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools.

•	Calculate  the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

•	Calculate the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

•	Calculate the school performance based on the spending per student.

•	Calculate the school performance based on the size of the school.

•	Calculate the school performance based on the type of school.

#### School performance based on the spending per student
The school performance based on the spending per student shows that the overall passing percentage is highest for the schools having spending per student < $584. The schools whose spending per student is $645-675 have the lowest overall percentage.
